abstract = {A shortened form of the self-splicing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intervening sequence of Tetrahymena thermophila acts as an enzyme in vitro. The enzyme catalyzes the cleavage and rejoining of oligonucleotide substrates in a sequence-dependent manner with Km = 42 μM and kcat = 2 min-1. The reaction mechanism resembles that of rRNA precursor self-splicing. With pentacytidylic acid as the substrate, successive cleavage and rejoining reactions lead to the synthesis of polycytidylic acid. Thus, the RNA molecule can act as an RNA polymerase, differing from the protein enzyme in that it uses an internal rather than an external template. At pH 9, the same RNA enzyme has activity as a sequence-specific ribonuclease.}}

abstract = {Summary
The Azoarcus group I ribozyme was broken into four fragments, 39–63 nucleotides long, that can self-assemble into covalently contiguous ribozymes via RNA-directed recombination events. The fragments have no activity individually yet can cooperate through base pairing and tertiary interactions to produce stable trans complexes at 48°C. These complexes can then catalyze a sequence of energy-neutral recombination reactions utilizing other oligomers as substrates, assembling covalent versions of the ribozyme. Up to 17% of the original fragments are converted into ∼200 nucleotide products in 8 hr. Assembly occurs primarily by only one of many possible pathways, and the reaction is driven in the correct and forward direction by the burial of key base-pairing regions in stems after recombination. Autocatalysis, and hence self-replication, is inferred by a reaction rate increase upon doping the reaction with full-length RNA.}

abstract ={The hammerhead, hairpin, hepatitis delta virus (HDV), Varkud Satellite (VS), and glmS ribozymes catalyze sequence-specific intramolecular cleavage of RNA. They range between 50 and 150 nucleotides in length, and are known as the “small self-cleaving ribozymes.” Except for the glmS ribozyme that functions as a riboswitch in Gram-positive bacteria, they were originally discovered as domains of satellite RNAs. However, recent studies show that several of them are broadly distributed in genomes of organisms from many phyla. Each of these ribozymes has a unique overall architecture and active site organization. Crystal structures have revealed how RNA active sites can bind preferentially to the transition state of a reaction, whereas mechanistic studies have shown that nucleobases can efficiently perform general acid–base and electrostatic catalysis. This versatility explains the abundance of ribozymes in contemporary organisms and also supports a role for catalytic RNAs early in evolution.},

This biologically active RNA fold is the same as that found previously for two modified hammerhead ribozymes. Addition of divalent cations at low pH makes it possible to capture the uncleaved RNA in metal-bound form. A conformational intermediate, having an additional Mg(II) bound to the cleavage-site phosphate, was captured by freeze-trapping the RNA at an active pH prior to cleavage. The most significant conformational changes were limited to the active site of the ribozyme, and the changed conformation requires only small additional movements to reach a proposed transition-state.}}

Ribozymes tend to be compositionally unbiased, as is the vast majority of possible sequence space. However, ribonucleotides vary greatly in synthetic yield, reactivity and degradation rate, and their non-enzymatic polymerization results in compositionally biased sequences. While natural selection could lead to complex sequences, molecules with some activity are required to begin this process. Was the emergence of compositionally diverse sequences a matter of chance, or could prebiotically plausible reactions counter chemical biases to increase the probability of finding a ribozyme? Our in silico simulations using a two-letter alphabet show that template-directed ligation and high concatenation rates counter compositional bias and shift the pool toward longer sequences, permitting greater exploration of sequence space and stable folding. We verified experimentally that unbiased DNA sequences are more efficient templates for ligation, thus increasing the compositional diversity of the pool. Our work suggests that prebiotically plausible chemical mechanisms of nucleic acid polymerization and ligation could predispose toward a diverse pool of longer, potentially structured molecules. Such mechanisms could have set the stage for the appearance of functional activity very early in the emergence of life. }",

ABSTRACT = {Efficiently accessing the information contained in non-linear and high dimensional probability distributions remains a core challenge in modern statistics. Traditionally, estimators that go beyond point estimates are either categorized as Variational Inference (VI) or Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques. While MCMC methods that utilize the geometric properties of continuous probability distributions to increase their efficiency have been proposed, VI methods rarely use the geometry. This work aims to fill this gap and proposes geometric Variational Inference (geoVI), a method based on Riemannian geometry and the Fisher information metric. It is used to construct a coordinate transformation that relates the Riemannian manifold associated with the metric to Euclidean space. The distribution, expressed in the coordinate system induced by the transformation, takes a particularly simple form that allows for an accurate variational approximation by a normal distribution. Furthermore, the algorithmic structure allows for an efficient implementation of geoVI which is demonstrated on multiple examples, ranging from low-dimensional illustrative ones to non-linear, hierarchical Bayesian inverse problems in thousands of dimensions.},

abstract = {An exact method is presented for numerically calculating, within the framework of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics, the time evolution of any spatially homogeneous mixture of molecular species which interreact through a specified set of coupled chemical reaction channels. The method is a compact, computer-oriented, Monte Carlo simulation procedure. It should be particularly useful for modeling the transient behavior of well-mixed gas-phase systems in which many molecular species participate in many highly coupled chemical reactions. For “ordinary” chemical systems in which fluctuations and correlations play no significant role, the method stands as an alternative to the traditional procedure of numerically solving the deterministic reaction rate equations. For nonlinear systems near chemical instabilities, where fluctuations and correlations may invalidate the deterministic equations, the method constitutes an efficient way of numerically examining the predictions of the stochastic master equation. Although fully equivalent to the spatially homogeneous master equation, the numerical simulation algorithm presented here is more directly based on a newly defined entity called “the reaction probability density function.” The purpose of this article is to describe the mechanics of the simulation algorithm, and to establish in a rigorous, a priori manner its physical and mathematical validity; numerical applications to specific chemical systems will be presented in subsequent publications.}

ABSTRACT = {The RNA world is one of the principal hypotheses to explain the emergence of living systems on the prebiotic Earth. It posits that RNA oligonucleotides acted as both carriers of information as well as catalytic molecules, promoting their own replication. However, it does not explain the origin of the catalytic RNA molecules. How could the transition from a pre-RNA to an RNA world occur? A starting point to answer this question is to analyze the dynamics in sequence space on the lowest level, where mononucleotide and short oligonucleotides come together and collectively evolve into larger molecules. To this end, we study the sequence-dependent self-assembly of polymers from a random initial pool of short building blocks via templated ligation. Templated ligation requires two strands that are hybridized adjacently on a third strand. The thermodynamic stability of such a configuration crucially depends on the sequence context and, therefore, significantly influences the ligation probability. However, the sequence context also has a kinetic effect, since non-complementary nucleotide pairs in the vicinity of the ligation site stall the ligation reaction. These sequence-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic effects are explicitly included in our stochastic model. Using this model, we investigate the system-level dynamics inside a non-equilibrium &lsquo;RNA reactor&rsquo; enabling a fast chemical activation of the termini of interacting oligomers. Moreover, the RNA reactor subjects the oligomer pool to periodic temperature changes inducing the reshuffling of the system. The binding stability of strands typically grows with the number of complementary nucleotides forming the hybridization site. While shorter strands unbind spontaneously during the cold phase, larger complexes only disassemble during the temperature peaks. Inside the RNA reactor, strand growth is balanced by cleavage via hydrolysis, such that the oligomer pool eventually reaches a non-equilibrium stationary state characterized by its length and sequence distribution. How do motif-dependent energy and stalling parameters affect the sequence composition of the pool of long strands? As a critical factor for self-enhancing sequence selection, we identify kinetic stalling due to non-complementary base pairs at the ligation site. Kinetic stalling enables cascades of self-amplification that result in a strong reduction of occupied states in sequence space. Moreover, we discuss the significance of the symmetry breaking for the transition from a pre-RNA to an RNA world.},
